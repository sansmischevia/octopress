  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    I like to travel and meet new people. Occasionally I'll slay some code. I'm passionate about building and creating lasting value through technology. I also like to contribute and stay involved with non-profits. Please check out <a href="http://www.ottp-sf.org/">http://www.ottp-sf.org/</a> to learn more about how OTTP helps at risk youth here in San Francisco.
