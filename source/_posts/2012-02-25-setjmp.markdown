``` c static variables
#include <stdio.h>
#include <setjmp.h>

static jmp_buf buf;

int main(void)
{
   volatile int b = 36;

   if (setjmp(buf) != 0)
   {
      printf(" bryant is: %d years old\n", b);
      exit(0);
   }
   b = 25;
   longjmp(buf, 1);
}
```
What gets printed out?

1. bryant is 25 years old 
1. bryant is 36 years old
1. "eff it, don't care."
1. SegFault

Nothing like a good ol' setjmp to kick off this blog. Check back more for interesting coding samples, notes on what it's like to work at a Silicon Valley startup, and my travels. All wrapped in ... code.
