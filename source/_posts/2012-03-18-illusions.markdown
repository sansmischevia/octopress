Last week I posted a picture of my new development setup in my office: [yfrog](http://yfrog.com/h7sp2ezj)

This setup has over 7000 diagonal pixels, and most people would think, 'wow I could be so productive if I had two 22" and one 27" monitor!'. Well after using this setup for a few days and actively developing with 170 degrees of LCD fury pointing at my two small eyes, my conclusion is this: There isn't a lot gained from using this set up.

### Awesome

 * You will never have to 'hide' windows. You will almost always know where everything is... simply because it's visible and not hidden.
 * Prevents other people from distracting me (22" towers make even the most persistent PM second guess approaching my _zone of flow_)
 * Pull up multiple documentation sources and not have to worry about your tab order. It also probably cuts down your Cmd-Tab or Alt-Tabs by a third.
 * Makes my investment in [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/) worth every penny I paid. You can't have this kinda of screen real estate and not use SizeUp. Even for normal desktops (like my 13" MacBook Air), SizeUp is very handy.

### Possum

The Illusion of Information. Didn't you think it would be great if you could throw up XCode in one monitor, and have your Android DDMS perspective open in another? Well I thought so, especially since I was making backend changes that would have affected both versions of our SDK. I thought it'd be much easier if I had multiple windows open, so that I can check everything concurrently. Well this all would have been fine and dandy, but unfortunately, my brain is only capable of responding to a few things at once. The combination of all these different windows made it even MORE difficult to concentrate. Net-net, this was an amusing setup, but I think I'll just go back to my one 27" iMac display next week.

Also, I don't have much desk space now to peel my pomelo.
